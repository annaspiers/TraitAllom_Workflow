These documents and scripts support the processing of trait and allometry data bases. The script is intended to work particularly the TRY data base, but it provides a framework to incorporate data from additional sources.



* [TidyTraitAllomDB.Rmd](TidyTraitAllomDB.html).  This (mostly) R Markdown script takes data downloaded from the TRY data base (plus additional sources) and apply [tidy data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) standards. In a tidy data set, each row represents one observation, each column represents a variable, and each cell represents a value. In addition, categorical traits are also harmonised into consistent categories and species taxonomy is standardised to the best extent possible (likely with some user input).

In the future, additional utilities for analysing trait and allometry will be incorporated to this workflow.

**Important**
1. Make sure to download the directory "RUtils" available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mpaiao/TraitAllom_Workflow), and set variable `util_path` accordingly for scripts that have this variable.
